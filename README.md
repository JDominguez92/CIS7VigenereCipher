# CIS7VigenereCipher

This Vigenere Cipher utilizes ASCII values to shift a message based on the characters of a keyword provided by a user.
This is done by switching the charater to an integer, shifting the text, then returning it to a character. This continues for the legnth of the message.<br><br>

This program was written in an online compiler in C++, when the program is started the user should be prompted to make a choice.<br>
Once the choice is made the user can enter a message and keyword, the output should then be displayed.<br>
The program should then ask to restart the program or stop it, then does so based on the response.<br><br>

There are still aspects of this program that can be improved and I plan to come back to this as I learn more about C++.<br><br>
